Two ways to populate shopping list:

1. manually adding the item
2. adding a recipe. Checks inventory for existing ingredients and has option to automatically add missing ingredients.

Once item is in shopping list, can modify:
- item
- alternatives (array of string)
- quantity / units
- notes

Delete or Bought (push to inventory table)
